### Python - Notes and Tasks

Introduction to python

**Libraries:**
1) Pandas: Provides data structures like DataFrames, making it easy to manipulate and analyze structured data.

2) NumPy: Offers support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

3) Matplotlib: A plotting library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

4) Seaborn: Built on Matplotlib, it simplifies complex visualizations and enhances aesthetics.

5) SciPy: A library for scientific and technical computing that builds on NumPy, providing additional functionality for optimization, integration, and statistics.

6) Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.

7) Data Cleaning and Preparation: Python's libraries, especially Pandas, provide powerful tools for cleaning and transforming data, handling missing values, and merging datasets.

8) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Python allows analysts to perform EDA using statistical techniques and visualizations, helping to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies.

9) Statistical Analysis: Python supports various statistical tests and methods, making it suitable for hypothesis testing and inferential statistics.

10) Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics: With libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, Python enables the development of predictive models and machine learning algorithms.

**Python - Print Statement** - The function is a built-in function used to display output to the console (standard output). It can be used to display strings, variables, or the result of expressions.

**Python - Operators** - This notebook covering Python operators, interpreter vs compiler, id() function, variables vs constants, number system conversion, swapping variables, math module, and user input.

**Python - Variables, Data Types, Typecasting** - This notebook contains Python basics notes on variables, data types, and type casting.

**TASK - Raw data to Clean data** - Cleaning raw data by splitting address and timestamp, then exporting clean data to Excel.
